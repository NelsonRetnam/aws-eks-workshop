Before we get started on building, publishing and deploying our NPM application, we must set up our workshop environment. In this setup section, we will:

- Set up our AWS account and IAM roles.
- Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
- Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
- Install and configure the JFrog CLI.
- Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.

There are two tracks for completing this workshop as follows. 

1. You are at an AWS-hosted event 
   * This will be powered by Event Engine
1. You are doing this workshop by yourself 
   * You will need to use your own AWS account

There are slightly different setup instructions depending on your track so make sure you are on the correct one!
